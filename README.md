# XSharp Tools README

This is the README for the extension "XSharp Tools".  

The extension and its settings are available via the command palette of Visual Studio Code, or by ***Right-Clicking*** on a **.xsproj** file.  

## Features

- It offers commands and context menus to build and/or run XSharp projects from within Visual Studio Code by running the **dotnet build** and **dotnet run** commands.  
The project must be contained in a folder, and a file with the name of the folder with **.xsproj** extension will be the Project File.  
Be carefull that the **FolderName** and the **ProjectName** must be the same name, otherwise it will not work properly.  
The result of the build will appear in the *Problems* tab of Visual Studio Code.  
- You can define some settings for your **.xsproj** file (more to come)  

- Starting from Version 0.4.0, the package integrate a basic LSP Client that communicates with the [xsharp-lsp-server](https://github.com/fforay/xsharp-lsp-server). The installer (.vsix) will contain the XSharpLanguageServer.exe. The server must be **published** as a self-contained EXE and put into the **server** folder before creating the vsix file.

## Requirements

You must have the latest XSharp Language version installed.  
You can get it here : http://www.xsharp.eu  

It is good also to install the [X# Lang extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=InfomindsAG.xsharp-lang) in order to have Syntax Highlighting, if you want more options.

## Extension Settings

Show Errors   : If true, show errors in the Problems Panel  
Show Warnings : If true, show warnings in the Problems panel  
GroupByFile   : Group Errors and Warnings by File.  

## Hidden LSP Server settings

If you want to track down what the LSP Server is doing, you can log some of its work.  

The Language Server will search for an Environment Variable called **XSHARPLSP_LOG_PATH**.  
If the var doesn't exist, nothing will be logged.
If the var indicates a folder, you should find a **XSharpLSPYYYYMMDD.log** file in that folder. It will contains some informations about the LSP Server work.

## Installation

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/fforay/xsharp-tools/releases) and get the lastest **.vsix** file.  
Adapt the procedure with the current vsix filename.

From the CLI, run:   
code --install-extension xsharp-tools-0.1.0.vsix

From VSCode
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P
- Type : Extensions: Install from VSIX
- Select the .vsix file in the explorer

## Compile & Package the extension

The LSP server must be "published" as a self-contained EXE and put into the **server** folder before creating the vsix file

Compile with :  

    npm run compile

Create .vsix with :  

    vsce package
